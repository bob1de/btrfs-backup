btrfs-backup
============
This project supports incremental backups for *btrfs* using *snapshots*
and *send/receive* between filesystems. Think of it as a basic version
of Time Machine.

Backups can be stored either locally or remotely (e.g. via SSH).

Its main goals are to be **reliable** and **functional** while
maintaining **user-friendliness**. It should be easy to get started in
just a few minutes without detailled knowledge on how btrfs send/receive
works. However, you should have a basic understanding of snapshots and
subvolumes.

btrfs-backup has almost no dependencies and hence is well suited for
many kinds of setups with only minimal maintenance effort.

Originally, it started as a fork of
https://github.com/lordsutch/btrfs-backup. Since then, most of the code
has been rewritten and many new features were added.

Features
--------
-  Initial creation of full backups
-  Incremental backups on subsequent runs
-  Different backup storage engines:
-  Local storage
-  Remote storage via SSH
-  Custom storage: Alternatively, the output of ``btrfs send`` may be
   piped to a custom shell command.
-  Simple and configurable retention policy for local and remote
   snapshots
-  Creation of backups without root privileges, if some special
   conditions are met
-  Detailled logging output with configurable log level


Requirements
------------
-  Python 3.3 or later
-  Appropriate btrfs-progs; typically you'll want **at least** 3.12 with
   Linux 3.12/3.13
-  (optional) OpenSSH's ``ssh`` command for remote backup storage
-  (optional) ``pv`` command for displaying progress during backups


Installation
------------
Install via PIP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The easiest way to get up and running is via PIP. If ``pip3`` is missing
on your system and you run a Debian-based distribution, simply install
it via:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-wheel

Then, you can fetch the latest version of btrfs-backup:

::

    $ sudo pip3 install btrfs_backup

Manual installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alternatively, clone this git repository

::

    $ git clone https://github.com/efficiosoft/btrfs-backup
    $ cd btrfs-backup
    $ git checkout tags/v0.2  # optionally checkout a specific version
    $ sudo ./setup.py install


Sample usage
------------
(as root)

::

    $ btrfs-backup /home /backup

This will create a read-only snapshot of ``/home`` in
``/home/snapshot/YYMMDD-HHMMSS``, and then send it to
``/backup/YYMMDD-HHMMSS``. On future runs, it will take a new read-only
snapshot and send the difference between the previous snapshot (tracked
with the symbolic link ``.latest``) and the new one.

**Note: Both source and destination filesystems need to be btrfs
volumes.**

For the backup to be sensible, they shouldn't be the same filesystem.
Otherwise you could just snapshot and save the hassle.

You can backup multiple volumes to multiple subfolders or subvolumes on
the destination. For example, you might want to backup both ``/`` and
``/home``. The main caveat is you'll want to put the backups in separate
folders on the destination drive to avoid confusion.

::

    $ btrfs-backup / /backup/root
    $ btrfs-backup /home /backup/home

If you really want to store backups of different subvolumes at the same
location, you have to specify a prefix using the ``--snapshot-prefix``
option. Without that, ``btrfs-backup`` can't distinguish between your
different backup chains and will mix them up. Using the example from
above, it could look like the following:

::

    $ btrfs-backup --snapshot-prefix root / /backup
    $ btrfs-backup --snapshot-prefix home /home /backup

You can specify ``--num-snapshots <num>`` to only keep the latest
``<num>`` number of snapshots on the source filesystem.
``--num-backups <num>`` does the same for the backup location.


Backing up regularly
--------------------
With anacron on Debian, you could simply add a file
``/etc/cron.daily/local-backup``:

.. code:: sh

    #!/bin/sh
    ionice -c 3 /path/to/btrfs-backup --quiet --num-snapshots 1 --num-backups 3 \
                /home /backup/home

More or less frequent backups could be made using other ``cron.*``
scripts.


Restoring a snapshot
--------------------
If necessary, you can restore a whole snapshot by using e.g.

::

    $ mkdir /home/snapshot
    $ btrfs send /backup/YYMMDD-HHMMSS | btrfs receive /home/snapshot

Then you need to take the read-only snapshot and turn it back into a
root filesystem:

::

    $ cp -aR --reflink /home/snapshot/YYMMDD-HHMMSS /home

You might instead have some luck taking the restored snapshot and
turning it into a read-write snapshot, and then re-pivoting your mounted
subvolume to the read-write snapshot.


Locking
-------
There is no locking. If you back up too often (i.e. more quickly than it
takes to make a snapshot, which can take several minutes on a filesystem
with lots of files), you might end up with a new backup starting while
an old one is in progress.

You can workaround the lack of locking using the ``flock(1)`` command,
as suggested at https://github.com/lordsutch/btrfs-backup/issues/4. For
example, in ``/etc/cron.hourly/local-backup``:

.. code:: sh

    #!/bin/sh
    flock -n /tmp/btrfs-backup.lock \
        ionice -c 3 /path/to/btrfs-backup --quiet --num-snapshots 1 --num-backups 3 \
                    /home /backup/home

You may omit the ``-n`` parameter if you want to wait rather than fail
in case a backup is already running.


Alternative workflow
--------------------
An alternative structure is to keep all subvolumes in the root directory

::

    /
    /active
    /active/root
    /active/home
    /inactive
    /snapshot/root/YYMMDD-HHMMSS
    /snapshot/home/YYMMDD-HHMMSS

and have corresponding entries in ``/etc/fstab`` to mount the subvolumes
from ``/active/*``. One benefit of this approach is that restoring a
snapshot can be done entirely with btrfs tools:

::

    $ btrfs send /backup/root/YYMMDD-HHMMSS | btrfs receive /snapshot/home
    $ btrfs send /backup/home/YYMMDD-HHMMSS | btrfs receive /snapshot/root
    $ mv /active/root /inactive
    $ mv /active/home /inactive
    $ btrfs subvolume snapshot /snapshot/root/YYMMDD-HHMMSS /active/root
    $ btrfs subvolume snapshot /snapshot/home/YYMMDD-HHMMSS /active/home

The snapshots from btrfs-backup may be placed in ``/snapshots/`` by
using the ``--snapshot-folder`` option.
